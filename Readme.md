## What problem does this codebase solve?

This codebase solves the problem of having to manually update my portfolio through code every time I want to add or change content. By implementing a login system and an edit mode within the interface, I can easily update my content such as project details and personal information directly from the frontend, without needing to modify the code or redeploy the application. This makes the portfolio more flexible, maintainable, and future proof.
